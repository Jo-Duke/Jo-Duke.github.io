## **To be able to become a better player there are some things you must do to improve**
*1. Confidence*
> Confidence is a very undervalued skill to have, working hard is essential of course but you have to understand that if you're not confident in what you do the effort you put in every day would not have so much of an effect. Now you know that confidence is an important skill now what do you do to become confident? Skill-wise you have to put up reps, stay in the gym, shoot at least 200 shots per day, and do drills to improve your overall game. Skill wise that is what an athlete should do but psychology wise this video will help you.
